# StackCraft
StackCraft is an automated multi-tier web application setup built using Vagrant, VirtualBox, and provisioning scripts. It deploys a complete application stack - including Nginx, Tomcat, MySQL, Memcached, and RabbitMQ across multiple virtual machines and configures them to work together as a fully functional web platform.
